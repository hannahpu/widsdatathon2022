Discuss project timeline.
Plan: each get familiar with the data, do some eda, think about work task plans to start the project.
Set up google colab, github repo to collaborate.

## Feb 8, 2022
Discuss findings we found in each our eda and model baseline train test rmse.
Some findings from the eda:
    1. Energy star rating is the most correlated feature. Also most predictive from a quick random forst model (no feature engineer and imputation done, no tuning done).
    2. Use Year_factor to do leave_year_out
    3. Some columns has missing, including energy star rating.
    4. Train have heavy imbalanceness in state_8, which is not included in test data
Plan:
Hannah to push model utils to run leave_year_out
Meng write function for energy star rating by grouping factors such as state, year built
Diana write functions to process times series weather data features

## Feb 11, 2022
Discuss findings from our current model result.
1. PCA of temperature features shows to be most predictive, adding precipitation in PCA didn't seem to have additional improvement.
2. Using state/year imputation shows to include more noise than how Catboost model is treating missing value (minimum value).
3. Most performance improved from ~62 to ~32 (from very base feature model to feature engineered model).
Plan:
1. Develop model to predict missing value for energy star rating (eg. random forest, LDA)
2. Write up function to upsample/downsample the dataset (eg. by state_factor)
3. After finish feature engineer tasks, we can consider to try out more complex models such as neural network since the number of data is large.
